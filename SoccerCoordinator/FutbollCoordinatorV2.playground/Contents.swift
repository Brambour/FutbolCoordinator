// ** Part 2: ** Create logic to iterate through all 18 players and assign them to teams such that the number of experienced players on each team are the same. Store each teamâ€™s players in its own new collection variable for use in Part 3. (Please note: your logic should work correctly regardless of the initial ordering of the players and should work, if we theoretically had more or less than 18 players, so NO MAGIC NUMBERS!)

// so unbelievably confused what to do to append values from keys to order and equally create teams - probably already did the dictionary wrong but i can pull values out by using something like players["Joe Smith"]?[0]
